# portfolio_update_v1
Hi all!

My project for unit 1,

I validated the html and css, I got a hit on experience.html for the font family
name black ops one, but that is the actual name I got from google and it does
work.

I have checked it for functionality in Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.

I added an additional page, styling to the profile pic, and under the Experience
page a new <p> with extra image.

Thanks for taking a look at my work, have a great day!
